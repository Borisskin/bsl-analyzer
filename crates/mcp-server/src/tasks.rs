//! The second branch of execution, `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks`.
//!
//! A resident-reading tool has two ways to answer a caller that arrives while the analysis
//! database is still being built. The synchronous branch publishes a `loading` envelope and
//! asks the caller to come back. The branch here hands back a durable handle instead: the
//! work is queued on the daemon, the caller polls `tasks/get`, and what it eventually reads
//! is the real answer — never a repackaged `loading` body.
//!
//! Which branch a caller gets is the caller's own choice. Only a client that declared the
//! extension can be handed a task, and the decision is taken here rather than left to the
//! dispatcher: the dispatcher's own guard replaces a task result for a non-declaring client
//! with `-32021`, so leaning on it would turn today's `loading` answer into an error for
//! every client that never asked for tasks.
//!
//! The registry lives on [`crate::SharedState`], one per daemon backend, so a handle
//! outlives the connection that created it. It does not outlive the process: a daemon that
//! exits on its idle timer takes its handles with it, and a later `tasks/get` is answered
//! `-32602`, the same as any unknown id.
